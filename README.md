Apparantly, this only works on elementaryOs Luna as of now. 
There are theme issues if this is tested on Ubuntu, and it might not work as expected.

Current TODO Stuff:
1. Check the concept of soft-delete.
2. Sync only the required stuff now i.e. > usn
3. Use getSyncChunk to sync.
4. Mark Dirty records in update queries.
5. Fix Path related issues so that images are displayed.
6. Create an icon for the application.
7. Create a settings window popup to display user related settings.
8. Add a option to set Notebook as default to Notebook Right click context menu.
