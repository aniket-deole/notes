Apparantly, this only works on elementaryOs Luna as of now. 
There are theme issues if this is tested on Ubuntu, and it might not work as expected.

Current TODO Stuff: <br/>
1. Check the concept of soft-delete.<br>
2. Sync only the required stuff now i.e. > usn<br>
3. Use getSyncChunk to sync.<br>
4. Mark Dirty records in update queries.<br>
5. Fix Path related issues so that images are displayed.<br>
6. Create an icon for the application.<br>
7. Create a settings window popup to display user related settings.<br>
8. Add a option to set Notebook as default to Notebook Right click context menu.<br>
9. Check details with respect to adding full screen / no disturbance mode to text window.<br>
10.Fix Maximize / Restore buttons, when window is dragged to the edge.<br>
