Notes For Linux

A Note taking application for Linux build in Gtk that aims to be an Evernote client.

Apparantly, this only works on elementaryOs Luna as of now. 
There are theme issues if this is tested on Ubuntu, and it might not work as expected.

Current TODO Stuff: <br/>
1. Create Package for distribution. <br/>
2. Create an icon for the application.<br/>
3. Create a settings window popup to display user related settings.<br/>
4. Add a option to set Notebook as default to Notebook Right click context menu.<br/>

I'm currently working on a C++ library that encapsulates the Thrift library so that the implementation is easier and cleaner. Check it out here. https://github.com/aniket-deole/libevernote
